# Real-Time Chat Application : https://chat-app-790p.onrender.com

## Overview
This is a fully functional real-time chat application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack with WebSockets (Socket.io) for seamless real-time communication. The application supports authentication, message persistence, online user status tracking, and a modern UI built with TailwindCSS and Daisy UI.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Enables instant communication using WebSockets (Socket.io).
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure user authentication with JWT.
- **Online User Status**: Tracks and displays online users dynamically.
- **User Profile Management**: Allows users to update their profile details and avatars.
- **Global State Management**: Implemented using Zustand for efficient client-side state handling.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive client-side and server-side error handling.
- **Scalability & Performance**: Optimized backend and frontend architecture for handling multiple concurrent users.
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Image and file uploads managed via Cloudinary.
- **Production-Ready Deployment**: Configured for seamless deployment on cloud platforms.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend:
- React.js (Functional Components, Hooks)
- TailwindCSS & Daisy UI (Responsive and modern UI design)
- Zustand (Lightweight state management)

### Backend:
- Node.js & Express.js (REST API architecture)
- MongoDB & Mongoose (NoSQL database and ODM)
- JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication
- Socket.io (Real-time WebSockets for messaging)

### DevOps & Deployment:
- Cloudinary (Media storage)
- Environment configuration with `.env`
- Deployment on cloud platforms (Render)

## Why This Project?
This project showcases my ability to architect, develop, and deploy full-stack applications with real-time capabilities. It demonstrates my expertise in backend API development, frontend user experience optimization, and handling real-world challenges such as authentication, performance optimization, and scalability.
